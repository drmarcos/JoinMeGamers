This registration system was developed using PHP version 5.3.8.
It is a resource created to contribute to Gamers who like to share the possibility of forming teams with friends.
Very useful for Gamers that use liveStream, as it is possible to have a more dynamic interaction with your audience.
It aims to create a waiting list where teams can be formed by matches.
You will be able to privilege players who are subscribed to your channel as a way to reward them.

INSTALLATION: 
 -----------------------------
Does not require any advanced technical knowledge, just place the unzipped files in the directory on your server; you only need to change the settings necessary for it to work properly.
 -----------------------------
 THEMES : 
 -----------------------------
 You can easily modify and or create themes, just duplicate an existing directory and rename it, that way you can quickly configure it by editing the .css files and replacing the images.
 
 Depois é só dizer o caminho no arquivo config.php
